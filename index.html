  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p> Lets paste some text! This year during the first week of September was “Local Week” at UMBC’s dining hall True Grits. Everyday the dinning hall was featuring produce from local farms. I am  the Director of Media for UMBC’s The Garden, a student created community food garden on campus, and so I was emailed by Tom DeLuca, the Resident District Manager of the dining hall, he was asking if we would like to be featured during Local Week. Most exciting about this email was his offer to buy any vegetables we had available, with cash. I was stunned. </p> 
  <p>One of the primary reasons that the The Garden was created was to address the food related issues that our country faces. We rely on an industrial food system that produces food that is overwhelming unhealthy for us to eat and unsustainable for our natural ecosystems. The United States is facing what many scholars label an obesity epidemic. The National Institute of Health states that 35.7% of adults are obese. This figure is double for minority populations. As a social entrepreneur, I have asked myself what role I can play in the national movement to create a new food paradigm.</p>
  <p>Tom De Luca’s offer gave me the idea. True Greens is a social entrepreneurial venture that uses vacant space at the UMBC greenhouse to grow microgreens. Microgreens are plants that are harvested after 14 days, the baby plants are rich in flavor, color, and have been proven to be more nutrient dense then when harvested in their adult forms. The quick turn around allows a small space to be very productive. I estimate that with current amount of space alloted in the greenhouse, True Greens will produce 10 pounds of micro greens a week. This may not seem like a lot but the mission of True Greens is twofold. First, to develop a working relationship with Chartwells staff in the dining hall and second to provide UMBC students with their first experience of sustainable produce grown on the campus itself. </p>
